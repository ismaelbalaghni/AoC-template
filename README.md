# Advent of Code 20XX Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 20XX challenges.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual online event where a new coding challenge is released each day from December 1st to December 25th. The challenges are a fun way to practice problem-solving and coding skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by day for the year 2023. Each day's solution is in a separate folder named with the day number, such as `01`, `02`, and so on. For example, the solution for the challenge from December 5th, 20XX would be in the folder `05`.

## Running the Code

Each solution is a standalone script. To run a solution, navigate to the correct directory and run the script using the appropriate command for your language of choice.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my own solutions, contributions are welcome! If you have a different solution or a solution in a different language, feel free to open a pull request.
